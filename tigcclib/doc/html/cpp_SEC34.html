<P>The <CODE>#if</CODE> directive allows you to test the value of an arithmetic
expression, rather than the mere existence of one macro.  Its syntax is
<PRE>#if <I>expression</I>

<I>controlled text</I>

#endif /* <I>expression</I> */
</PRE>
<I>expression</I> is a C expression of integer type, subject to stringent
restrictions.  It may contain
<UL>
<LI>
Integer constants.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Character constants, which are interpreted as they would be in normal
code.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, bitwise operations, shifts, comparisons, and logical
operations (<CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> and <CODE>||</CODE>).  The latter two obey the usual
short-circuiting rules of standard C.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Macros.  All macros in the expression are expanded before actual
computation of the expression's value begins.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Uses of the <CODE>defined</CODE> operator, which lets you check whether macros
are defined in the middle of an <CODE>#if</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Identifiers that are not macros, which are all considered to be the
number zero.  This allows you to write <CODE>#if&nbsp;MACRO</CODE> instead of
<CODE>#ifdef&nbsp;MACRO</CODE>, if you know that MACRO, when defined, will
always have a nonzero value.  Function-like macros used without their
function call parentheses are also treated as zero.
<BR><BR>
In some contexts this shortcut is undesirable.  The <B>'-Wundef'</B>
option causes GCC to warn whenever it encounters an identifier which is
not a macro in an <CODE>#if</CODE>.
</UL>
The preprocessor does not know anything about types in the language.
Therefore, <CODE>sizeof</CODE> operators are not recognized in <CODE>#if</CODE>, and
neither are <CODE>enum</CODE> constants.  They will be taken as identifiers
which are not macros, and replaced by zero.  In the case of
<CODE>sizeof</CODE>, this is likely to cause the expression to be invalid.
<BR><BR>
The preprocessor calculates the value of <I>expression</I>.  It carries
out all calculations in the widest integer type known to the compiler;
on most machines supported by GCC this is 64 bits.  This is not the same
rule as the compiler uses to calculate the value of a constant
expression, and may give different results in some cases.  If the value
comes out to be nonzero, the <CODE>#if</CODE> succeeds and the <I>controlled
text</I> is included; otherwise it is skipped.
<BR><BR>
If <I>expression</I> is not correctly formed, GCC issues an error and
treats the conditional as having failed.
