Why doesn't this work?
<PRE>void *screen_ptr = LCD_MEM;
*screen_ptr = 0xFF;
</PRE>
When I do this, I get the error "Invalid use of void expression" at the
second line. Can't you assign a value to a dereferenced void pointer?
If not, what good is a void pointer?

You can not dereference a void pointer, without an explicite typecasting,
because the compiler can't know the size of an object pointed to by it.
You can do an explicite typecast:
<PRE>*(char*)screen = 0xFF;
</PRE>
Or better, if you need to dereference it often, then declare
<PRE>unsigned char *screen = LCD_MEM;
</PRE>
i.e. avoid void pointers for this purpose (continue reading to see why
such assignment is legal, i.e. assigning <A HREF="graph_LCD_MEM.html">LCD_MEM</A>
which is a void pointer to a char pointer).

Void pointers are used mainly as arguments of functions which
represents memory addresses, no matter what is the object located at
that addresses. Then, any pointer type (including arrays, which are
in fact pointers to the first element of the array) may be passed
to such function without warnings and without needness for explicite
typecasting. For example, <A HREF="mem_memcpy.html">memcpy</A> is such
function, and it is declared as:
<PRE>void *memcpy (void *source, void *destination, unsigned long len);
</PRE>
Ignore returned type for a moment. So, you can do
<PRE>memcpy (LCD_MEM, buffer, 3840);
</PRE>
but you also can do
<PRE>memcpy (a, b, 10 * sizeof(long));
</PRE>
assuming that you have declared
<PRE>long a[10], b[10];
</PRE>
somewhere in the program. Second, void pointers may be assigned to any
other pointer type and vice versa without and warnings and without
needness for explicite typecasting. They are usually returned as the
result of functions which don't make any assumptions what will be
purpose of returned pointer. For example, <A HREF="alloc_malloc.html">malloc</A>
is such function. It is declared as
<PRE>void *malloc (unsigned long len);
</PRE>
So, assuming that you have declared
<PRE>char *a;
int *b;
long *c;
</PRE>
you can do
<PRE>a = malloc (100);
b = malloc (30 * sizeof(int));
c = malloc (50 * sizeof(long));
</PRE>
without any problems.
