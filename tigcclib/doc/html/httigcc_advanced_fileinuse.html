<P>With this definition, the program's <A HREF="vat_SYM_ENTRY.html">in use</A> (a.k.a. hidden)
bit is set while the program is running. Normally, this isn't necessary; however, the event dispatching loop deletes
<A HREF="vat_SymAddTwin.html">twin symbols</A> unless their in-use bit is set. In many cases,
programs which might be archived will not call the event dispatching loop directly. However, dialog
boxes (including the catalog) <I>do</I> call the event dispatching loop. The result: If an archived
program uses dialog boxes (including the catalog), then the program's twin symbol will get
deleted. Thus, the area of memory the program occupies gets freed, and the program will almost
certainly crash. Setting this bit is handled automatically now, but you can still set it manually by defining
this at the beginning of a file:
<PRE>#define SET_FILE_IN_USE_BIT
