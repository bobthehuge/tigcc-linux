<P>WinHide hides a window pointed to by <I>w</I> (mark it as not-visible so that it is never
activated by the system) and updates the screen. When a window is activated
(see <A HREF="wingraph_WinActivate.html">WinActivate</A>) or when it is opened (unless the
<A HREF="wingraph_WinFlags.html">WF_VIRTUAL</A> flag is passed to <A HREF="wingraph_WinOpen.html">WinOpen</A>), it is
marked as visible. All windows in the system are kept in a linked list. When a window in the
system is closed, the next visible window in the system is activated and becomes the currently
active window. Since virtual windows are never displayed on the screen they are never considered
visible. An application's main window is always visible since that is the only view the user has
of the application. From the other side, an application may open other windows that it does not
want to ever be activated. In that case, use WinHide so that they will never be activated by
the system. Although the given window will not be activated by the system, writes to it still
go to the screen (unless it is a virtual window).
