<P>You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <CODE>asm</CODE> (or <CODE>__asm__</CODE>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:
<PRE>int foo asm (&quot;myfoo&quot;) = 2;
</PRE>
This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <CODE>foo</CODE> in
the assembler code should be <CODE>myfoo</CODE> rather than the usual
<CODE>foo</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.
<BR><BR>
It does not make sense to use this feature with a non-static local
variable since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC97.html">Explicit
Reg Vars</A>.  GCC presently accepts such code with a warning, but will
probably be changed to issue an error, rather than a warning, in the
future.
<BR><BR>
You cannot use <CODE>asm</CODE> in this way in a function <I>definition</I>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a <I>declaration</I> for the function
before its definition and putting <CODE>asm</CODE> there, like this:
<PRE>extern func () asm (&quot;FUNC&quot;);

func (int x, int y)
/* ... */
</PRE>
It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GCC
does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers.
Perhaps that will be added.
