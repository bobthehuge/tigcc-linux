How can you control where a program data is stored in the calculator's memory, and
then how to access the data? By looking at your programs (cblaster etc.), you simply
use <A HREF="mem_memcpy.html">memcpy</A> to write to the array, which seems so easy!
Is the array kept in memory because it's declared as static?
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A:</B></TD><TD>
Yes. Every static and global data (i.e. data which are declared out of functions)
are kept in the <CODE>.89z</CODE>/<CODE>.9xz</CODE> file itself (more precise, in the area of the memory allocated to
<CODE>.89z</CODE>/<CODE>.9xz</CODE> file), so they will survive after the end of the program.  Local data
are stored on the stack (so they will be deleted after the end of the function in which
they are declared).
