<P>Let's get these out of the way first:
<UL>
<LI>
The verification file <B>'-v'</B> option is not supported.  Diagnostic
messages always appear on the console.  They also appear in the
listing file, however (see extensions below).  You can produce
an error file by redirecting console output to a file - the
line number counter and final summary are displayed on stderr
so you can still see what's happening.
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC)</B></TD><TD>
<B>WARNING:</B> The new -v switch introduced in v.2.71.F3c is <B>NOT</B> the same as this one!</TD></TR></TABLE>
<LI>
The file names in the <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directory list <B>'-i'</B> must be
separated by commas.  The list may not be enclosed in quotes.
<LI>
Labels assigned by <CODE>EQUR</CODE> and <CODE>REG</CODE> directives are case-sensitive.
<LI>
Strange things will happen if your source code (including
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files and macro expansions) exceeds 32,766 lines.
Tough darts.  Break up your source file.  Can you actually
read that monster?
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC)</B></TD><TD>
The maximum has been increased from 32,766 to 2,147,483,646 for
32-bit operating systems starting from version 2.71.F3s.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<LI>
Directives <CODE>OFFSET</CODE>, <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>, <CODE>LLEN</CODE>, <CODE>PLEN</CODE>,
<CODE>NOOBJ</CODE>, <CODE>FAIL</CODE>, <CODE>FORMAT</CODE>, <CODE>NOFORMAT</CODE> and
<CODE>MASK2</CODE> are not supported, and will be flagged
as invalid op-codes.
I feel that <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>, <CODE>LLEN</CODE>, and <CODE>PLEN</CODE> should not be
defined within a source module.  It doesn't make sense to me to have to change
your program just because you want to print your listings on
different paper.  The command-line switch <B>'-p'</B> (see below) can
be used as a replacement for <CODE>PLEN</CODE>; setting it to a high value
(like 32767) is a good substitute for <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>.  The effect of
<CODE>LLEN</CODE> can be obtained by running the listing file through an
appropriate filter.
