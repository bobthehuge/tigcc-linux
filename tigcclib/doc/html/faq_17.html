I would like to know if it is possible to use the sprite functions
in <A HREF="sprites.html">sprites.h</A> with grayscale. I have tried
using the <A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> function with
grayscale, and none of the sprites I intended to be in grayscale appeared.
I tried to use <A HREF="graph_DrawIcon.html">DrawIcon</A> and the grayscale
worked just fine. But <A HREF="graph_DrawIcon.html">DrawIcon</A> is too
slow... Can <A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> and
<A HREF="sprites_Sprite32.html">Sprite32</A> handle grayscale sprites.

Very common question in a recent time. See, you probably tried to use
<A HREF="gray_GraySetAMSPlane.html">GraySetAMSPlane</A>.
<A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> have a parameter for drawing
plane, so it is not sensitive to <A HREF="gray_GraySetAMSPlane.html">GraySetAMSPlane</A>:
you need to give the plane as an explicite parameter. In fact, you need to
have two different sprite planes and to draw a sprite twice, passing two
different planes as a parameter. For example,
<PRE>static unsigned short light_definition [] = {...};
static unsigned short dark_definition [] = {...};
...
Sprite16 (x, y, height, light_definition, GrayGetPlane (LIGHT_PLANE), A_XOR);
Sprite16 (x, y, height, dark_definition, GrayGetPlane (DARK_PLANE), A_XOR);
</PRE>
In other words, sprite routines <I>can</I> handle grayscale
sprites, but not natively, meaning you have to take your grayscale
sprite, split it into two layers, and draw each one separately on its
own plane - the routine does not handle these by itself. As suggested
by Scott Noveck, it is possible to make a function of your own to
handle this. Assume that your grayscale sprites follow the "standard"
format seen in the most of ASM games, with the dark plane data followed
immediately by the light plane data. This routine will call
<A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> twice - once for each plane:
<PRE>void GraySprite16 (short x, short y, short h, unsigned short *spr, short mode)
{
  Sprite16 (x, y, h, *spr, GetPlane (LIGHT_PLANE), mode);
  Sprite16 (x, y, h, *spr + h, GetPlane (DARK_PLANE), mode);
}
</PRE>
Don't be afraid about calling <A HREF="gray_GrayGetPlane.html">GrayGetPlane</A> each
time: it is not a waste of time. Its implementation is smart: when the input
is a constant, it will simply evaluate to a memory address that
contains the pointer; when it is variable, it expands to a simple macro.
