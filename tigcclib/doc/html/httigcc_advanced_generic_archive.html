<P>If you are writing a function archive (also known as a static library), you
will probably want to write:
<PRE>#define _GENERIC_ARCHIVE
</PRE>
at the top of every C file that includes a header file from the TIGCC
Library. It tells the TIGCC Library that you are creating a function archive
(static library) which you want programs to be able to use no matter what
their compiler, TIGCCLIB, linker and output format settings are. It disables
all optimizations which rely on startup code, and it makes the library use a
kernel-independent ROM call mechanism. It also disables outputting of any
linker control symbols which force a specific output format.
<BR><BR>
All static libraries should use this option unless they are created for a
very specific program (which implies you are probably better off linking the
files directly into your project). However, some special features of the
TIGCC Library may not be available.
