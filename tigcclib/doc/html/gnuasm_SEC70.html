<P>Syntax: <B>.align <I>alignment</I>[, [<I>fill</I>][, <I>max</I>]]</B>
<BR><BR>
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular storage
boundary.  <I>alignment</I> (which must be absolute) is the alignment
required, as described below.
<BR><BR>
<I>fill</I> (also absolute) gives the fill value to be stored in the
padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is omitted, the
padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some systems, if the section is
marked as containing code and the fill value is omitted, the space is filled
with no-op instructions (I didn't checked whether this is the case in TIGCC).
<BR><BR>
<I>max</I> is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it is present,
it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by this alignment
directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping more bytes than the
specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at all.  You can omit the
fill value (the second argument) entirely by simply using two commas after the
required alignment; this can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled
with no-op instructions when appropriate.
<BR><BR>
The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to system.
For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, Xtensa, and Renesas / SuperH SH,
and i386 using ELF format,
the first expression is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example <CODE>.align&nbsp;8</CODE> advances
the location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.
<BR><BR>
For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the arm and
strongarm, it is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example <CODE>.align&nbsp;3</CODE> advances the location
counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.
<BR><BR>
This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which <CODE>as</CODE> must emulate.
<CODE>as</CODE> also provides <CODE><A HREF="gnuasm_SEC74.html">.balign</A></CODE> and <CODE><A HREF="gnuasm_SEC113.html">.p2align</A></CODE> directives,
which have a consistent behavior across all
architectures (but are specific to <CODE>as</CODE>).
