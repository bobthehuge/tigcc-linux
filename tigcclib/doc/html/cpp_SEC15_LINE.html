<P>This macro expands to the current input line number, in the form of a
decimal integer constant.  While we call it a predefined macro, it's
a pretty strange macro, since its &quot;definition&quot; changes with each
new line of source code.
<BR><BR>
<CODE><A HREF="cpp_SEC15_FILE.html">__FILE__</A></CODE> and <CODE>__LINE__</CODE> are useful in generating an error
message to report an inconsistency detected by the program; the message
can state the source line at which the inconsistency was detected.  For
example,
<PRE>fprintf (stderr, &quot;Internal error: &quot;
                 &quot;negative string length &quot;
                 &quot;%d at %s, line %d.&quot;,
         length, __FILE__, __LINE__);
</PRE>
An <CODE>#include</CODE> directive changes the expansions of <CODE>__FILE__</CODE>
and <CODE>__LINE__</CODE> to correspond to the included file.  At the end of
that file, when processing resumes on the input file that contained
the <CODE>#include</CODE> directive, the expansions of <CODE>__FILE__</CODE> and
<CODE>__LINE__</CODE> revert to the values they had before the
<CODE>#include</CODE> (but <CODE>__LINE__</CODE> is then incremented by one as
processing moves to the line after the <CODE>#include</CODE>).
<BR><BR>
A <CODE>#line</CODE> directive changes <CODE>__LINE__</CODE>, and may change
<CODE>__FILE__</CODE> as well.  See <A HREF="cpp_SEC41.html">Line Control</A>.
<BR><BR>
C99 introduces <CODE>__func__</CODE>, and GCC has provided <CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE>
for a long time.  Both of these are strings containing the name of the
current function (there are slight semantic differences; see <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC102.html">Function Names as Strings</A>).
Neither of them is a macro; the preprocessor does not know the
name of the current function.  They tend to be useful in conjunction
with <CODE>__FILE__</CODE> and <CODE>__LINE__</CODE>, though.
