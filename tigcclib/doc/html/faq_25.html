I have problems with allocating memory with TIGCC.
When I run my program the first time, it works just as expected,
but the second (or sometimes the third) time I run it, it hangs.
Typical memory allocation problem. But I just can't understand what the
problem is.

The problem is very probably not related to the dynamic memory allocation, but
to the usage of static variables. At the moment, all static vars need to
be initialized, even to nothing. I.e, you need to use
<PRE>static int a = 0, b = 0;
static char *ptr = NULL;
</PRE>
instead of
<PRE>static int a, b;
static char *ptr;
</PRE>
I expect that this will solve your problems. I hope that Xavier will implement automatic
initialization of all static data in the near future.
