The documentation about <A HREF="menus_MenuPopup.html">MenuPopup</A>
says that it is possible to make popup menus by picking up bytes
with the VTI debugger to save the memory, but I don't know how to
do this. Could you tell me how to do this, please?

Not so easy to explain if you are not an experienced user. Basically, after you
define a menu using <A HREF="menus_PopupNew.html">PopupNew</A>,
<A HREF="menus.html">PopupAddText</A> etc., you need to display its address
instead of executing it. E.g. instead of doing
<PRE>PopupDo (handle, ...)
</PRE>
you need to do something like:
<PRE>printf_xy (0, 50, "Address=%lp", HeapDeref (handle));
ngetchx();
</PRE>
Then, while waiting for a keypress, open the VTI debugger and go to the
displayed address. Take a pencil and write a sequence of bytes starting
from this address. Tenth and eleventh byte in this sequence will tell to you
how many bytes you need to pick. After this, put these bytes in the array,
and pass such array as an argument to the <A HREF="menus_MenuPopup.html">MenuPopup</A>
function. As an exercise, try this on an example given in the documentation.
