<P>Syntax: <B>.org <I>new-lc</I>[, <I>fill</I>]</B>
<BR><BR>
Advance the location counter of the current section to
<I>new-lc</I>.  <I>new-lc</I> is either an absolute expression or an
expression with the same section as the current subsection.  That is,
you can't use <CODE>.org</CODE> to cross sections: if <I>new-lc</I> has the
wrong section, the <CODE>.org</CODE> directive is ignored.  To be compatible
with former assemblers, if the section of <I>new-lc</I> is absolute,
<CODE>as</CODE> issues a warning, then pretends the section of <I>new-lc</I>
is the same as the current subsection.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>.org</CODE> may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use <CODE>.org</CODE> to move the location counter
backwards.
<BR><BR>
Because <CODE>as</CODE> tries to assemble programs in one pass, <I>new-lc</I>
may not be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await
a chance to share your improved assembler.
<BR><BR>
Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other
people's assemblers.
<BR><BR>
When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced, the
intervening bytes are filled with <I>fill</I> which should be an
absolute expression.  If the comma and <I>fill</I> are omitted,
<I>fill</I> defaults to zero.
