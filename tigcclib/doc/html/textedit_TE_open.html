<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Initializes the text editor.</B>
<P>TE_open initializes the text editor and displays the initial contents of the editor. All
text editor operations are controled using a structure of type
<A HREF="textedit_TEXT_EDIT.html">TEXT_EDIT</A>. TE_open will initialize such a structure pointed
to by the parameter <I>te</I>, which later needs to be passed to all text editor operations
(i.e. <I>te</I> must be allocated statically to maintain state between calls to the text
edit routines). It returns <A HREF="alloc_Bool.html">TRUE</A> if the edit buffer could
be allocated, or <A HREF="alloc_Bool.html">FALSE</A> if there is insufficient memory to
allocate the edit buffer. This routine always returns <A HREF="alloc_Bool.html">TRUE</A>
if <I>BufHandle</I> is passed in with the handle to a text buffer.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> The window <I>w</I> must already be open. The handle <I>BufHandle</I> must not
be locked.
<BR><BR>
This routine may cause heap compression.
<BR><BR>
<I>w</I> is a pointer to the parent window of the editor: you can create a new window to be
the parent using <A HREF="wingraph_WinOpen.html">WinOpen</A>, or you can pass
<A HREF="wingraph_DeskTop.html">DeskTop</A> as the parameter, if you are happy with
its settings (which is usually the case). <I>rect</I> is a pointer to the
<A HREF="wingraph_WIN_RECT.html">WIN_RECT</A> structure which describes the actual
dimensions of the rectangular text editor area (You can pass
<A HREF="alloc_NULL.html">NULL</A> to use entire client rectangle of the window <I>w</I>
for the edit region). Note that if you use your own window as a parent window, this
window must not be "dirty" (i.e. it must not have the
<A HREF="wingraph_WinFlags.html">WF_DIRTY</A> flag set). Windows created by
<A HREF="wingraph_WinOpen.html">WinOpen</A> are "dirty" by default, so you need to clear
the "dirty" flag manually before calling TE_open. For example, you can do
<PRE><I>w</I>-&gt;Flags &amp;= ~WF_DIRTY;
</PRE>
<I>BufHandle</I> is the handle of the text editor buffer, which may be pre-filled with the
text (if you want to edit existing text), or filled with zeros (if you want to create a new
text). <I>BufHandle</I> may be, for example, the result of a
<A HREF="alloc_HeapAlloc.html">HeapAlloc</A> operation. <I>BufHandle</I> can also be
<A HREF="alloc_H_NULL.html">H_NULL</A>, in this case TE_open  will allocate a new handle
and initialize it with no text. Note that contrary to what I said in the documentation of
TIGCCLIB releases prior to 2.2, it cannot be a handle of a text variable, because text variables
contain additional system data on the begining, and the editor expect raw data (see the
<A HREF="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A> to learn how you can pass a text
variable to the editor though).
<BR><BR>
The contents of the text buffer are a standard zero-terminated string, in which lines of
text are separated with '\r' characters (0xD). The size of the buffer is managed automatically
by the editor: it will be expanded if necessary to add more text, so you need not to worry
about the allocated size.
<BR><BR>
The parameter <I>cur_offset</I> is the initial position of the cursor
(counted from the begining of the buffer). Position 0 is to the left of the first
character. If the contents of the text edit buffer are too
long to display entirely in the edit region, the text is
scrolled to make sure the cursor is visible.
Set <I>cur_offset</I> to <A HREF="textedit_TE_FAR_RIGHT.html">TE_FAR_RIGHT</A> to place the edit cursor
after the last character in the edit buffer.
<BR><BR>
The parameter <I>ReadOnly</I> is the count of characters
at the begining of the buffer which can't be modified (i.e. which are read-only). <I>ReadOnly</I>
is usually set to zero, except in some special applications. The <I>ReadOnly</I> characters are 
considered to be part of a prompt (or of command characters as in the text editor) so the user
cannot change the text of the <I>ReadOnly</I> characters nor move the edit cursor into them.
<BR><BR>
<I>Flags</I> is a set of binary flags which controls the editor. Each bit specifies optional
features of the text editor. Some of these flags are changed automatically during the operation
of the editor. The flags are defined in the <A HREF="textedit_ETE_FLAGS.html">ETE_FLAGS</A>
enumeration and have the following meanings:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_WRAP</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Set this flag for multiline edit regions. Reset
it for single-line edit regions: the editor will operate in "compact" mode, in which the editor
is only one character high, and where the contents of the editor will scroll left/right when
necessary (such a mode is used in request boxes in dialogs). In "compact" mode, the contents of
the editor buffer must not contain '\r' characters, else the editor will be fooled. In multiline
edit regions, text can wrap around the end of the line to the beginning of the next line. The
program editor is an example of a multiline edit region. The Home screen entry line is an
example of a single-line edit region.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_COLON</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">When set, each line of the editor will be
preceded with a colon ("<B>:</B>"), like in the "Text editor" or the "Program editor". When
TE_COLON is reset, there will not be a preceding colon. The program editor uses this flag to
mark the beginning of each line of the program.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_COMMANDS</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">When set, the first character of
each line will be regarded as "command character", and it will be displayed before the colon.
The "Text editor" application uses this mode to store editor commands (like "P" = "PrintObj"
etc.). Note that when this flag is set, the parameter <I>cur_offset</I> must not be zero (it
is usually set to 1 in this case).<BR>
<B>Note:</B> This flag includes the TE_COLON flag (as needed by the AMS).
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_MORE_ARROWS</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Set this flag to display arrows at the
left and right ends of a <I>single-line</I> edit region to indicate when more
text is to the left or right of the edit region.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_MORE_ELLIPSES</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Set this flag to display ellipses
(...) at the left and right ends of a <I>single-line</I> edit region to indicate when
more text is to the left or right of the edit region.<BR>
<B>Note:</B> This flag includes the TE_MORE_ARROWS flag (as needed by the AMS).
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_SELECT</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag is an internal flag. It is set if
there currently is a selection in the text editor. It is clear if nothing is selected.
Do not set this flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_CURSOR</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag is an internal flag. It represents
the current blinking state of the cursor: it is set if the blinking cursor is currently visible.
Do not set this flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_FIXED_LENGTH</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag is an internal flag. It is set
for text editors opened with <A HREF="textedit_TE_openFixed.html">TE_openFixed</A>. Do not set this
flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_CHANGED</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag is an internal flag. It is a status
flag which, if 1, indicates the contents of the edit buffer have changed. Do not set this
flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_FOCUSED</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag is an internal flag. It is set if
the text editor currently has the focus, i.e. if the cursor is currently in the text editor.
See <A HREF="textedit_TE_focus.html">TE_focus</A> and <A HREF="textedit_TE_unfocus.html">TE_unfocus</A>.
Do not set this flag.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_AUTO_ANS</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Set this flag to 1 to cause "ans(1)" to be
inserted automatically when the edit buffer is empty and an arithmetic operation is typed.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">TE_READ_ONLY</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">When set, the editor enters read-only mode.
In this mode, the editor displays text and allows arrow keys to navigate through the edit
buffer, but it does not allow changing the text, i.e. you can't insert, delete or change any
characters.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> TE_open just initializes the editor, displays the intial content of it and exits.
It does not enter the editor loop in which keypresses are processed. In fact, there is no
such loop: you need to get keypresses manually (using <A HREF="kbd_ngetchx.html">ngetchx</A>
or, even better, using <A HREF="events_EV_getc.html">EV_getc</A>, or using
the default event loop <A HREF="events_EV_eventLoop.html">EV_eventLoop</A>) and to pass them
to <A HREF="textedit_TE_handleEvent.html">TE_handleEvent</A> which will process them. Such an approach
gives much more flexibility. See <A HREF="textedit_TE_handleEvent.html">TE_handleEvent</A> for an
example of usage.
