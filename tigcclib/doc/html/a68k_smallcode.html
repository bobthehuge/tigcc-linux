<P>Version 2.4 implements a rudimentary small code/data model.
It consists of converting any data reference to one of the following
three addressing modes:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
    address register indirect with displacement using a
        specified address register, defaulting to <CODE>A4</CODE>
        (for references to the <CODE>DATA</CODE> or <CODE>BSS</CODE> section);
<LI>
    program counter indirect with displacement
        (for references to the <CODE>CODE</CODE> section);
<LI>
    absolute word
        (for absolute and 16-bit relocatable values).
</UL>
These conversions do not take place unless a <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is
encountered.  The <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive can take one operand, which
must be either an address register or a symbol which has been
equated (using <CODE>EQUR</CODE>) to an address register.  Register <CODE>A7</CODE> (<CODE>SP</CODE>)
may not be used.  If no register is given, <CODE>A4</CODE> is assumed.
<BR><BR>
     Conversion is done for all operands until a <CODE>FAR</CODE> directive
is encountered.  <CODE>NEAR</CODE> and <CODE>FAR</CODE> directives can occur any number
of times, enabling conversion to be turned on and off at will.
<BR><BR>
     Backward references which cannot be converted (e.g. external
labels declared as <CODE>XREF</CODE>) will remain as absolute long addressing.
All forward references are assumed to be convertible, since during
pass 1 <CODE>A68k</CODE> has no way of telling whether conversion is possible.
If conversion turns out to be impossible, invalid object code will
be generated - an error message ("Invalid forward reference") will
indicate when this occurs.
<BR><BR>
Although the small code/data model can greatly reduce the
size of assembled programs, several restrictions apply:
<UL>
<LI>
Small code and small data models are active simultaneously.
You can't have one without the other, since during pass 1
A68k doesn't know whether forward references are to <CODE>CODE</CODE>
or to <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE>.
<LI>
Programs can consist of a maximum of two sections,
one <CODE>CODE</CODE>, the other <CODE>DATA</CODE> or <CODE>BSS</CODE>.  If you try to define
a third section, the message "Too many SECTIONs" will
be displayed.  The <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is active only within
the <CODE>CODE</CODE> section.
<LI>
While the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is active, external labels (<CODE>XREF</CODE>)
must be declared before they are used, <CODE>CODE</CODE> section references
must be with 32K of the current position (i.e. expressible as
PC-relative), and <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section references must be in the
first 64K of the <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section (i.e. expressible as
address register indirect with displacement).  Any instructions
which do not satisfy these requirements cannot be detected in
pass 1, so A68k has no choice but to display an error message
in pass 2 ("Invalid forward reference") which in this case
indicates that invalid code has been generated.  To properly
assemble such instructions, you can temporarily disable
conversion with a <CODE>FAR</CODE> directive, then resume afterwards
with another <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.
<LI>
Conversion cannot be done for references between modules.
All external references must be left as absolute long.
<LI>
<CODE>A68k</CODE> assumes that the base register (normally <CODE>A4</CODE>) points to
the start of the <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section plus 32768 bytes (this
assumed offset can be changed by the <B>'-m'</B> command-line parameter).
The register must be preloaded with this value before executing
any code converted by the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.  One way to do this
is to code the instruction that loads the register prior to
the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.  Another way is to use a <CODE>MOVE.L</CODE> with
immediate mode, which is never converted.  Here are examples
of the two methods:
<PRE>     LEA data+32768,a4                NEAR
     NEAR ;defaults to A4             MOVE.L #data+32768,a4
     &lt;remainder of code&gt;              &lt;remainder of code&gt;
     BSS                              BSS
data:                            data:
     &lt;data areas&gt;                     &lt;data areas&gt;
     END                              END
</PRE>
</UL>
I'll be the first to admit that this is a very crude and ugly
implementation.  I hope to improve it in future versions.
