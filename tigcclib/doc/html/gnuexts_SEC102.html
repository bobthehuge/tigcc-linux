<P>GCC predefines two magic identifiers to hold the name of the current
function.  The identifier <CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE> holds the name of the function
as it appears in the source.  The identifier <CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE>
holds the name of the function pretty printed in a language specific
fashion.
(These names are always the same in a C function, but in a C++ function
they may be different; don't care about this, because TIGCC is not a C++ compiler.)
<BR><BR>
The compiler automatically replaces the identifiers with a string
literal containing the appropriate name.  Thus, they are neither
preprocessor macros, like <CODE>__FILE__</CODE> and <CODE>__LINE__</CODE>, nor
variables.  This means that they catenate with other string literals, and
that they can be used to initialize char arrays.  For example
<PRE>char here[] = &quot;Function &quot; __FUNCTION__ &quot; in &quot; __FILE__;
</PRE>
On the other hand, <CODE>#ifdef&nbsp;__FUNCTION__</CODE> does not have any special
meaning inside a function, since the preprocessor does not do anything
special with the identifier <CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
Note that these semantics are deprecated, and that GCC 3.2 will handle
<CODE>__FUNCTION__</CODE> and <CODE>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</CODE> the same way as
<CODE>__func__</CODE>.  <CODE>__func__</CODE> is defined by the ISO standard C99:
<BR><BR>
The identifier <CODE>__func__</CODE> is implicitly declared by the translator
as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
definition, the declaration
<PRE>static const char __func__[] = &quot;function-name&quot;;
</PRE>
appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.
<BR><BR>
By this definition, <CODE>__func__</CODE> is a variable, not a string literal.
In particular, <CODE>__func__</CODE> does not catenate with other string
literals.
