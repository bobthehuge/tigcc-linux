<P>Relocation entries indicate that the program needs to know some addresses
which are only available at run time. In this case, the addresses referred
to are locations inside the program code or data. Usually, all references to
absolute addresses inside the program are inserted into the section if one
of these two insertions is used; however, sections may be marked as being
handled in another way, which prevents relocation entries to them from being
output in this way. The data section is automatically marked as handled if
it is externalized; the BSS section is marked as handled by referencing
<A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_kernel_bss_table.html">__ld_kernel_bss_table</A>, by
using
<A HREF="ld_insert_kernel_bss_refs.html">__ld_insert_kernel_bss_refs</A>
before inserting the relocation entries, or by reacting to the
<A HREF="ld_global_imports_auto.html">__handle_bss</A> global import.

__ld_insert_kernel_relocs uses the kernel format for storing relocation
entries, which is used by kernels on the TI-89, TI-92 Plus, and V200, and by
Fargo v0.2.0:
<UL>
<LI>For each relocation entry...
    <UL>
    <LI><B>2 bytes:</B> <I>location</I> (may not be 0)
    </UL>
<LI><B>2 bytes:</B> 0
</UL>
If a program uses this insertion, it must process it as follows:
<UL>
<LI>For each relocation entry...
    <UL>
    <LI>Get the starting address of the program (via
        <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_entry_point.html">__ld_entry_point</A>);
    <LI>Add the <I>location</I> value;
    <LI>Modify the 4-byte value (<I>offset</I>) at the resulting address:
        <UL>
        <LI>Get the starting address of the program (<I>relocation
            address</I>);
        <LI>Add the value of <I>offset</I>;
        <LI>Write the resulting address to the 4-byte space covered by
            <I>offset</I>.
        </UL>
    </UL>
</UL>
Before program termination, this process has to be reverted, so that it can
be repeated the next time the program starts. Since programs may be moved in
memory while they are not executed, they may <I>not</I> simply deactivate
the relocation code. This would also prevent programs from being transferred
between devices.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> Relocation entries may only be inserted at a single place in the
program. The reason for this is that the linker may have to add new
relocation entries after they have been written into the section. Instead of
keeping track of which entries have already been processed, we thought it
would be easier to remove them once they have been written into a section.
Also, it is dangerous to use this insertion from anything other than a
startup section.
