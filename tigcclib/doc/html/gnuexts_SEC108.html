<P>For compatibility with other compilers, GCC allows you to define
a structure or union that contains, as fields, structures and unions
without names.  For example:
<PRE>struct {
  int a;
  union {
    int b;
    float c;
  };
  int d;
} foo;
</PRE>
In this example, the user would be able to access members of the unnamed
union with code like <CODE>foo.b</CODE>.  Note that only unnamed structs and
unions are allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed
<CODE><A HREF="keywords_int.html">int</A></CODE>.
<BR><BR>
You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field definitions.
For example, this structure:
<PRE>struct {
  int a;
  struct {
    int a;
  };
} foo;
</PRE>
It is ambiguous which <I>a</I> is being referred to with <CODE>foo.a</CODE>.
Such constructs are not supported and must be avoided.  In the future,
such constructs may be detected and treated as compilation errors.
