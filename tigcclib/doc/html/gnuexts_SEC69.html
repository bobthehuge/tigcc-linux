<P>Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <CODE><A HREF="keywords_sizeof.html">sizeof</A></CODE>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <CODE><A HREF="keywords_typedef.html">typedef</A></CODE>.
<BR><BR>
There are two ways of writing the argument to <CODE>typeof</CODE>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:
<PRE>typeof (x[0](1))
</PRE>
This assumes that <I>x</I> is an array of pointers to functions;
the type described is that of the values of the functions.
<BR><BR>
Here is an example with a typename as the argument:
<PRE>typeof (int *)
</PRE>
Here the type described is that of pointers to <CODE><A HREF="keywords_int.html">int</A></CODE>.
<BR><BR>
An alternate keyword for <CODE>typeof</CODE> is <CODE>__typeof__</CODE>.
See <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC100.html">Alternate Keywords</A>.
<BR><BR>
A <CODE>typeof</CODE>-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <CODE><A HREF="keywords_sizeof.html">sizeof</A></CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>typeof</CODE> is often useful in conjunction with the
statements-within-expressions feature.  Here is how the two together can
be used to define a safe &quot;maximum&quot; macro that operates on any
arithmetic type and evaluates each of its arguments exactly once:
<PRE>#define max(a,b) \
  ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
      typeof (b) _b = (b); \
    _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</PRE>
The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.
<BR><BR>
Some more examples of the use of <CODE>typeof</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI>
This declares <I>y</I> with the type of what <I>x</I> points to.
<PRE>typeof (*x) y;
</PRE>
<LI>
This declares <I>y</I> as an array of such values.
<PRE>typeof (*x) y[4];
</PRE>
<LI>
This declares <I>y</I> as an array of pointers to characters:
<PRE>typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
</PRE>
It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:
<PRE>char *y[4];
</PRE>
To see the meaning of the declaration using <CODE>typeof</CODE>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:
<PRE>#define pointer(T) typeof(T *)
#define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
</PRE>
Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:
<PRE>array (pointer (char), 4) y;
</PRE>
Thus, <CODE>array&nbsp;(pointer&nbsp;(char),&nbsp;4)</CODE> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>.
</UL>
<I>Compatibility Note:</I> In addition to <CODE>typeof</CODE>, GCC 2 supported
a more limited extension which permitted one to write
<PRE>typedef <I>T</I> = <I>expr</I>;
</PRE>
with the effect of declaring <I>T</I> to have the type of the expression
<I>expr</I>.  This extension does not work with GCC 3 (versions between
3.0 and 3.2 will crash; 3.2.1 and later give an error).  Code which
relies on it should be rewritten to use <CODE>typeof</CODE>:
<PRE>typedef typeof(<I>expr</I>) <I>T</I>;
</PRE>
This will work with all versions of GCC.
