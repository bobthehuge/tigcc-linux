<P>There are two ways of rendering comments to <CODE>as</CODE>.  In both
cases the comment is equivalent to one space.
<BR><BR>
Anything from <CODE>/*</CODE> through the next <CODE>*/</CODE> is a comment.
This means you may not nest these comments.
<PRE>/*
  The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
  is to use this sort of comment.
*/

/* This sort of comment does not nest. */
</PRE>
Anything from the <U>line comment</U> character to the next newline
is considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is
<CODE>|</CODE> on the 680x0 family of processors.  
<BR><BR>
To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with <CODE>#</CODE> have a
special interpretation.  Following the <CODE>#</CODE> should be an absolute
expression (see <A HREF="gnuasm_SEC60.html">Expressions</A>): the logical line number of the <I>next</I>
line.  Then a string (see <A HREF="gnuasm_SEC33.html">Strings</A>) is allowed: if present it is a
new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.
<BR><BR>
If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)
<PRE>                          # This is an ordinary comment.
# 42-6 &quot;new_file_name&quot;    # New logical file name
                          # This is logical line # 36.
</PRE>
This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of <CODE>as</CODE>.
