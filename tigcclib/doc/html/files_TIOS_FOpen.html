<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Open a file for a specific mode.</B>
<P>FOpen opens the file <I>fileName</I> for the mode <I>mode</I>. <I>fileName</I> is not a tokenized variable name (as required by the symbol
table code), but rather a normal zero-terminated C string of characters. It must not be a reserved
name. If <I>fileName</I> does not contain a folder name, the file will be stored in (or read from)
the current folder. Internally, files are stored as custom (third-party) data-type files
(<A HREF="estack_Tags.html#OTH_TAG">OTH_TAG</A>). They will show up to the user in the VAR-LINK screen
as the type specified when the file was opened (up to four letters).
<BR><BR>
When a file is opened with FOpen in <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_WRITE</A> or <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_APPEND</A> mode,
the associated variable is locked and inaccessible by any other routines in
the system. It must be closed with <A HREF="files_TIOS_FClose.html">FClose</A> to return the variable to a not-in-use mode,
to write the file type and the <A HREF="estack_Tags.html#OTH_TAG">OTH_TAG</A>, and to close
the associated buffer. For files opened in <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_READ</A> mode, the call to <A HREF="files_TIOS_FClose.html">FClose</A>
will merely update the mode of the file in the <A HREF="files_FILES.html">FILES</A> structure to closed and
clear the associated error status.
<BR><BR>
There is no separate mode to open a file for both reading and writing.
However, if a file is opened in <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_APPEND</A> mode, the contents of the file
are not erased and the file may be subsequently positioned to any location
in the file (random access) and either read from or written to.
For all access modes, the given name must not be a system variable. For
<A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_READ</A> and <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_APPEND</A> the name must correspond to an existing file of a custom data-type. For
<A HREF="files_fileMode.html">FM_WRITE</A> the file must either not exist or correspond to a file of a custom
data-type which is not locked or marked in-use.
<BR><BR>
Note that for files in read mode, <A HREF="files_TIOS_FClose.html">FClose</A> merely updates the
<I>fsPtr</I>->fileMode field in the <A HREF="files_FILES.html">FILES</A> structure to indicate it is closed. For write mode, it must be
called to update information in the file needed by the system. While a file is
in write mode, it is marked as in-use so that no other application, nor the
system itself, will try to access it (it will not be visible in the VAR-LINK screen
either). Files in write or append mode may be accessed randomly by
using <A HREF="files_TIOS_FSetPos.html">FSetPos</A>.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> Any number of files may be simultaneously opened in read mode. If multiple
files are opened simultaneously in write (or append) mode, all but the
first file must already exist before they are opened. Use the <A HREF="files_TIOS_FCreate.html">FCreate</A> routine if
they need to be created as empty files before they are opened with FOpen.
<BR><BR>
<I>typeName</I> must point to a normal (non-tokenized) zero-terminated C string of at most four characters
which describes the file type (<A HREF="files_FileStatusEnum.html">FS_ERROR</A> is returned
if it does not). If there is an existing file with the
same name as <I>fileName</I>, the types must match.
<BR><BR>
<I>fsPtr</I> is a pointer to a structure of type <A HREF="files_FILES.html">FILES</A>.
<BR><BR>
The parameter <I>mode</I> can be one of the following commands, as described in the <A HREF="files_fileMode.html">fileMode</A> enum:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
<TD>FM_READ</TD><TD>The file must exist and can only be read.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FM_WRITE</TD><TD>Open the file for writing and erase its contents. Create the file if it does not exist.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FM_APPEND</TD><TD>If the file exists, open it for writing at the end of the file. If it does not exist, then create it and open it for writing.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
FOpen returns one of the following values as described in the <A HREF="files_FileStatusEnum.html">FileStatusEnum</A> enum:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
<TD>FS_OK</TD><TD>The file was opened for the specified mode.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FS_ERROR</TD><TD>The file cannot be opened for the specified mode. (It may be locked or not of custom (OTH) data-type, or <I>typeName</I> may be invalid.)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FS_BAD_NAME</TD><TD><I>fileName</I> is invalid.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>FS_MEMORY</TD><TD>Not enough memory.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
The return value is also stored in <I>fsPtr</I>->fileStatus in the <A HREF="files_FILES.html">FILES</A> structure.<BR>
The <A HREF="files_FILES.html">FILES</A> pointer <I>fsPtr</I> may then be used in subsequent file routines.
<BR><BR>
This routine may cause heap compression or invalidate any current <A HREF="vat_HSym.html">HSym</A>s.
