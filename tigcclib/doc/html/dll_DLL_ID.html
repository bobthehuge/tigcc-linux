<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Defines the DLL identification number.</B>
<P>The DLL_ID macro is used for defining the DLL indentification number. It must be followed by a
32-bit constant unsigned integer, which will be embedded in the DLL image as a part of the
internal signature. For example:
<PRE>DLL_ID 372331723
</PRE>
Later, when a program wants to load the DLL, it passes the expected ID number as a parameter to the
<A HREF="dll_LoadDLL.html">LoadDLL</A> function. If the expected and embedded ID numbers are not the same, the DLL is simply ignored
(skipped). As <A HREF="dll_LoadDLL.html">LoadDLL</A> searches through all folders for a matching DLL, it is completely legal to
have several DLLs with the same name (in different folders) which differ only in their ID numbers.
<BR><BR>
DLL_ID must appear at the end of the DLL interface section, after all prototypes and global
declarations, and just before the <A HREF="dll_DLL_VERSION.html">DLL_VERSION</A> entry. See <A HREF="dll_DLL_INTERFACE.html">DLL_INTERFACE</A> for a detailed layout
of the DLL interface structure.
