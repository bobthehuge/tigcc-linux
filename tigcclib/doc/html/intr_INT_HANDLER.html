<P>INT_HANDLER is a pointer type which represents the address of the interrupt handler.
It might be logical that INT_HANDLER is defined as a pointer to a void function, i.e.
<PRE>typedef void (*INT_HANDLER)(void);
</PRE>
But this is not true. Instead, INT_HANDLER is a pointer to a strange structure
(its shape is completely irrelevant, as this structure is never used, neither
explicitely nor implicitely). Such unusual behaviour is implemented due to safety reasons.
First, with such implementation it is impossible to call an
interrupt handler using a simple function call (which would be possible if INT_HANDLER
is implemented as a pointer to a function). Second, as INT_HANDLER is a pointer to an
unusual structure, the compiler can emit a warning if you try to pass anything which
is not created using <A HREF="intr_DEFINE_INT_HANDLER.html">DEFINE_INT_HANDLER</A> or returned
from <A HREF="intr_GetIntVec.html">GetIntVec</A> to the functions <A HREF="intr_SetIntVec.html">SetIntVec</A>
and <A HREF="intr_ExecuteHandler.html">ExecuteHandler</A>. For example, you will be warned if
you try to pass an ordinary void function instead of properly-defined interrupt handler
to the <A HREF="intr_SetIntVec.html">SetIntVec</A>.
