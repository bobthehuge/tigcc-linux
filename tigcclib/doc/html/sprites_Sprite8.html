<P>Sprite8 draws a sprite with a width of 8 pixels or less on the screen.
Use <A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> or <A HREF="sprites_Sprite32.html">Sprite32</A> for wider sprites.
This routine is many times faster than TIOS routines like
<A HREF="graph_DrawIcon.html">DrawIcon</A>, <A HREF="graph_BitmapPut.html">BitmapPut</A>, etc.
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the sprite.
<I>height</I> is the height of the sprite. <I>sprite</I> is a pointer to the array of
unsigned characters which define the shape of the sprite (line by line). <I>vm_addr</I> is the pointer
to the video plane; it should be <A HREF="graph_LCD_MEM.html">LCD_MEM</A> if you are not using
grayscale or the <A HREF="graph_PortSet.html">PortSet</A> function. <I>mode</I> is the drawing
mode, and it may have one of the following values (these constants are defined in the enum
<A HREF="sprites_SprtModes.html">SprtModes</A>):

<TD>OR the sprite into a background. This is mainly used for masked sprites together with SPRT_AND.
OR means that every pixel with a corresponding '1' bit in the <I>sprite</I> array will be set to black, but all other pixels stay the same.
If you want to turn all other pixels to white instead, one way to achieve this would be to AND
the sprite as well.</TD>

In fact, you can use one of two techniques to draw sprites:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Non-masked sprites.</B> Using this method, the sprites are simply XORed into the background. This
technique was popular in many games on old 8-bit computers. To erase the sprite, it is
enough to call the routine again on the same position.
<LI>
<B>Masked sprites.</B> This is the more advanced method, which needs more programming practice,
but produces much better results. Using this method, you first need to erase a
part of the background which occupies a space where the sprite need to be displayed,
then to draw the actual sprite shape. To do this, AND the inverse of the sprite mask
to the background, then OR the sprite at the same location. However, it is not so
easy to restore the background later. For solving this problem, a lot of advanced
methods are developed (like "double-buffering", etc.). These methods are quite
common in advanced ASM games, and they are explained in many ASM tutorials.

Here is a simple example (called "Masked Sprite"), which first draws a simple "background", then draws a "masked"
sprite (which is a simple 8x8 square with solid edges and blank interior) at (30,30):
<PRE>// Display a masked sprite over an arbitrary background

#define USE_TI89              // Compile for TI-89
#define USE_TI92PLUS          // Compile for TI-92 Plus
#define USE_V200              // Compile for V200

#define OPTIMIZE_ROM_CALLS    // Use ROM Call Optimization
#define MIN_AMS 100           // Compile for AMS 1.00 or higher
#define SAVE_SCREEN           // Save/Restore LCD Contents

#include &lt;tigcclib.h&gt;         // Include All Header Files

// Main Function
void _main(void)
{
  static const unsigned char sprite[] = {0xFF,0x81,0x81,0x81,0x81,0x81,0x81,0xFF};
  static const unsigned char imask[] = {(unsigned char)~0xFF,(unsigned char)~0xFF,
    (unsigned char)~0xFF,(unsigned char)~0xFF,(unsigned char)~0xFF,
    (unsigned char)~0xFF,(unsigned char)~0xFF,(unsigned char)~0xFF};
  int i;
  ClrScr ();
  for (i = 0; i &lt;= LCD_WIDTH; i++)
    DrawLine (i, 0, i, LCD_HEIGHT, A_SHADE_NS);  // A simple background
  Sprite8 (30, 30, 8, imask, LCD_MEM, SPRT_AND);
  Sprite8 (30, 30, 8, sprite, LCD_MEM, SPRT_OR);
  ngetchx ();
}
</PRE>
Here the sprite mask is <CODE>{0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}</CODE>, but it needs to
be inverted before passing it to the Sprite8 function. For this purpose, the operator '~' may be
very useful. Note that '~' is "bitwise NOT". Of course, ~0xFF is the same as 0x00, but this notation
makes the program more clear (and it does not increase the code size, because the inverting will
be performed at compilation time). And if you want to use <A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A> or
<A HREF="sprites_Sprite32.html">Sprite32</A>, the notation ~0xFF will still be valid in a short int array, or in a long int array
if you add the <B>'L'</B> suffix (see the respective info about <A HREF="sprites_Sprite32.html">Sprite32</A>).
Without this notation, you must use 0x00 in Sprite8, but 0xFF00 in <A HREF="sprites_Sprite16.html">Sprite16</A>, and
0xFFFFFF00 in <A HREF="sprites_Sprite32.html">Sprite32</A>. This is why a notation like ~0xFF is more universal.

Starting from TIGCC v0.91, you can use binary numbers to define your sprites. On the one hand,
it makes the program incompatible with other C dialects as well as previous (ancient) versions of
TIGCC. On the other hand, it makes designing a sprite much easier
and also allows for editing the sprite at a later time without having to reconvert it.
The binary representation of the sprite presented above would look like this:
<PRE>static const unsigned char sprite[]={
0b11111111,
0b10000001,
0b10000001,
0b10000001,
0b10000001,
0b10000001,
0b10000001,
0b11111111};
