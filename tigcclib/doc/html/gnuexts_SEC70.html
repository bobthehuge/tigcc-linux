<P>Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.
<BR><BR>
For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:
<PRE>(a, b) += 5
a, (b += 5)
</PRE>
Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:
<PRE>&amp;(a, b)
a, &amp;b
</PRE>
A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:
<PRE>(a ? b : c) = 5
(a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</PRE>
A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <CODE>a</CODE> has type <CODE><A HREF="keywords_int.html">char</A>*</CODE>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:
<PRE>(int)a = 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</PRE>
An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <CODE>+=</CODE> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:
<PRE>(int)a += 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</PRE>
You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <CODE>&amp;(int)f</CODE> were
permitted, where <CODE>f</CODE> has type <CODE><A HREF="keywords_float.html">float</A></CODE>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:
<PRE>*&amp;(int)f = 1;
</PRE>
This is quite different from what <CODE>(int)f&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</CODE> would do - that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, the GNU team thinks it is better to prohibit use of <CODE>&amp;</CODE> on a cast.
<BR><BR>
If you really do want an <CODE><A HREF="keywords_int.html">int</A>*</CODE> pointer with the address of
<CODE>f</CODE>, you can simply write <CODE>(int*)&amp;f</CODE>.
