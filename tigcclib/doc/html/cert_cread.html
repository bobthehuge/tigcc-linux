<P>Certificate files in TIOS (which packages up all the data required to perform
authentification) are well-organized as files of variable-length records called
"fields". So, the different components are split up into various fields, which can
be accessed fairly easily. Each field begins with ID word. High 12 bits of ID
are used as field ID number, and lower 4 bits are used to encode size of the field
(as the length of the field can be a variable size). If these bits are smaller or
equal to 0xC, this value is just the length of the field. If these bits are 0xD,
0xE or 0xF, then the following byte, word or doubleword contains the actual length
of the field. Fields in the file are stored sequentially. They may contain various
data, including other fields (i.e. "subfields"), which are usually opened with
<A HREF="cert_copensub.html">copensub</A>.

cread reads a field from the file associated with the file context pointed to by
<I>context</I> and collects necessary information (field ID number, length
of the field, and the pointer to the actual content of the field) into the
<A HREF="cert_CERT_FIELD.html">CERT_FIELD</A> structure pointed to by <I>dest</I>. It also
moves the field pointer to the next field, and sets the EOF indicator in the
context if the end of the file is reached. cread returns <A HREF="alloc_Bool.html">TRUE</A>
if the operation was successful, otherwise it returns <A HREF="alloc_Bool.html">FALSE</A> (this usually
means end-of-file error).
