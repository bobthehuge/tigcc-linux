<P>The linker can convert absolute branches (which would normally need a
relocation entry) into special relative F-Line sequences. These sequences are
handled by an interrupt handler. The fact that an interrupt is needed makes
these branches significantly slower, but using them can save quite a bit of
space in the program.

There are two types of F-Line branches: The default version can be activated
using the <A HREF="ld_control_ld_use_fline_jumps.html">__ld_use_fline_jumps</A>
control symbol. Each branch has a size of six bytes. They are relative to
their own address, which means that they can be supported by the AMS, and in
fact, the AMS implements an interrupt handler for these branches starting
from version 2.04. The other version can be activated using the
<A HREF="ld_control_ld_use_4byte_fline_jumps.html">__ld_use_4byte_fline_jumps</A>
control symbol. As the name says, each branch has a size of four bytes. They
are relative to the program's entry point, so only an emulator that is
installed from the program can handle them. Since they use codes that are
otherwise used for ROM calls, this might break applications that are called
from the program, if any. However, this is very unlikely, as the two ROM
calls used are not defined yet.
