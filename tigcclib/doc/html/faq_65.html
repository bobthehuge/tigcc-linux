I need to know more about how the TIOS stores and references big integers.
In other words, what would be the C structure that would be used to represent
any arbitrarily-long binary integer? In addition, I am particularly interested
about how two extermely long binary integers would be multiplied and
divided. Does TIOS have its own binary multiplication routine somewhere in the
ROM? Something that works similarly to BCD multiplication/division, I'm guessing?
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A:</B></TD><TD>
TIOS stores all integers (both small and large) in the following format (looking from
lower to higher addresses):
<OL>
<LI>Bytes of the integer in little endian (up to 255 bytes);
<LI>The number of bytes occupied by integer (one byte);
<LI><A HREF="estack_Tags.html#POSINT_TAG">POSINT_TAG</A> or <A HREF="estack_Tags.html#NEGINT_TAG">NEGINT_TAG</A>,
depending on the sign.
</OL>
These integers are kept on the expression stack, or in TI-Basic
variables (of course, in TI-Basic variables, there are two extra bytes
at the begining, which represents the length of a variable). In other
words, integers are kept in a structure which is similar to the
<A HREF="rsa_BN.html">BN</A> structure defined in the <A HREF="rsa.html">rsa.h</A>
header file, except the length byte is at the end, not at the begining (because
data on the expression stack is always in RPN). So, such a structure can't be
strictly represented using valid C syntax, because it requires something like
<PRE>struct big_int
  {
    BYTE data[size];   // <I>but 'size' is not known in advance</I>
    BYTE size;
    BYTE tag;
  }
</PRE>
Routines for multiplying and dividing very long integers surely exist in the TIOS,
but the strange fact is that such routines are not in the TIOS jump table (read: they
are not usable). Anyway, you can always use general eveluating routines
like <A HREF="estack_NG_rationalESI.html">NG_rationalESI</A> and
<A HREF="estack_NG_approxESI.html">NG_approxESI</A>. For example, to multiply two
very-long-integers, you can use the following template:
<PRE><I>push two very-long-ints on the estack</I>
push_quantum (MULT_TAG);
NG_approxESI (top_estack);
</PRE>
However, two routines for working with long integers <B>are</B> in TIOS jump table:
for calculating <CODE>'(A*B)%N'</CODE> and <CODE>'(A^B)%N'</CODE> where "%" is the "modulus" operation,
and "^" is "raising to a power". These operations are used in the
RSA cryptosystem. Both of them are defined in the <A HREF="rsa.html">rsa.h</A> header file. They
may be used for multiplying and raising to a power: you always can set <CODE>N</CODE> to very a big
number, then <CODE>(A*B)%N&nbsp;=&nbsp;A*B</CODE>. Also, you can use them for calculating modulus
(if you set <CODE>B</CODE> to 1). But, I am not sure how you can simulate division. I
think that TI never uses integer division: everything like <CODE>'A/B'</CODE> is kept as
a fraction, except in approx mode; TIOS then uses <A HREF="estack_NG_approxESI.html">NG_approxESI</A>.
