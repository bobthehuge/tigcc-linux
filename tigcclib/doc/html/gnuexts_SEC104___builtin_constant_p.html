You can use the built-in function <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE> to
determine if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence
that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that
value.  The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
return of 0 does not indicate that the value is <I>not</I> a constant,
but merely that GCC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
value of the <B>'-O'</B> option.
<BR><BR>
If you have some complex calculation,
you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but need to call
a function if it does not.  For example:
<PRE>#define Scale_Value(X)      \
  (__builtin_constant_p (X) \
  ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))
</PRE>
You may use this built-in function in either a macro or an inline
function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
argument of the function as the argument to the built-in, GCC will
never return 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
or compound literal (see <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC81.html">Compound Literals</A>) and will not return 1
when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
specify the <B>'-O'</B> option.
<BR><BR>
You may also use <CODE>__builtin_constant_p</CODE> in initializers for static
data.  For instance, you can write
<PRE>static const int table[] = {
   __builtin_constant_p (EXPRESSION) ? (EXPRESSION) : -1,
   /* ... */
};
</PRE>
This is an acceptable initializer even if <I>EXPRESSION</I> is not a
constant expression.  GCC must be more conservative about evaluating the
built-in in this case, because it has no opportunity to perform
optimization.
<BR><BR>
Previous versions of GCC did not accept this built-in in data
initializers.  The earliest version where it is completely safe is
3.0.1.
