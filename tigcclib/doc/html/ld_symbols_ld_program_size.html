<P>This built-in symbol represents the size of the main section after all sections
are merged into one. If all sections are merged into a single section, this is
the size of the final linked program (<I>without</I> any headers or footers
required by the output format). If an external data variable is used, this
would be the size of the main executable only (but see the note about automatic
insertion below).<BR><BR>
Resolving of this symbol is delayed until the last pass of the linker in order
to ensure the size isn't changed by later range-cutting. Currently, this is the
same pass which also does <A HREF="ld_insert.html">automatic insertions</A>, so
insertions may or may not be counted.<BR><BR>
This symbol is currently used by the Flash OS support to write the OS size into
the header which is sent to the calculator. Flash operating systems do not use
relocation, so the lack of support for automatic insertions is not a problem in
this context.
