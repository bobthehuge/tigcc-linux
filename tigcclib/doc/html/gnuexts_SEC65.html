<P>You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator <CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE>.  The
+ value has type <CODE><A HREF="keywords_void.html">void</A>*</CODE>.  This value is a constant and can be used
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:
<PRE>void *ptr;
/* ... */
ptr = &amp;&amp;foo;
</PRE>
To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement, <CODE><A HREF="keywords_goto.html">goto</A>&nbsp;*<I>exp</I>;</CODE>.  For example,
<PRE>goto *ptr;
</PRE>
Any expression of type <CODE><A HREF="keywords_void.html">void</A>*</CODE> is allowed.
<BR><BR>
One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
will serve as a jump table:
<PRE>static void *array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar, &amp;&amp;hack };
</PRE>
Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:
<PRE>goto *array[i];
</PRE>
Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds - array
indexing in C never does that.
<BR><BR>
Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<CODE><A HREF="keywords_switch.html">switch</A></CODE> statement.  The <CODE>switch</CODE> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement very well.
<BR><BR>
You may not use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.
If you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.
<BR><BR>
An alternate way to write the above example is
<PRE>static const int array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo - &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar - &amp;&amp;foo,
                             &amp;&amp;hack - &amp;&amp;foo };
goto *(&amp;&amp;foo + array[i]);
</PRE>
This is more friendly to code living in shared libraries (DLLs), as it reduces
the number of dynamic relocations that are needed (and, by consequence,
would allow the data to be read-only).
