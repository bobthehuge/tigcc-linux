<P>The typecast operator forces an expression to behave as an object of a given type. It uses the
following syntax:
<PRE>(<I>type</I>) <I>expr</I>
</PRE>
The expression <I>expr</I> will be interpreted as having type <I>type</I>. It may
be any simple type (modified or unmodified), <A HREF="keywords_enum.html">enumeration</A>,
<A HREF="keywords_struct.html">structure</A>, <A HREF="keywords_union.html">union</A>, user
defined type created using <A HREF="keywords_typedef.html">typedef</A>, <A HREF="keywords_void.html">void</A> type, or
an anonymous type (see <A HREF="opers_asterisk.html">asterisk</A> for more information about anonymous
types). Here is an example list of valid typecast operators:
<PRE>(int)
(unsigned long int)
(signed)
(enum foo)
(struct foo)
(mytype)             <I>assuming that 'mytype' is defined with 'typedef'</I>
(void)
(char *)
(void *)
(struct foo *)
(void (*)(int))
(int (*[])(char*))
</PRE>
Typecast operator is very powerful in C, and may be used for conversion nearly <I>everything</I>
to <I>anything</I>. For example, it is legal to convert an integer value to a pointer, so you
can perform direct access to the memory (don't do this if you don't know exactly what are you
doing). For example, <CODE>'(char*)19456'</CODE> converts integer 19456 to a char pointer, which
may be dereferenced further using the <A HREF="opers_deref.html">dereference operator</A>. So,
<PRE>* (char*)19456 = 255;
</PRE>
stores 255 in the memory at the absolute address 19456 (this is the first byte of the LCD memory
on TI-89 and TI-92+). The more drastic example is
<PRE>((void(*)())10000)();
</PRE>
which calls the subroutine located at absolute address 10000 (first, the typecast operator
<CODE>'(void(*)())'</CODE> converts 10000 to the pointer to the function, then the
<A HREF="opers_parentheses.html">parentheses</A> operator <CODE>'()'</CODE> is used to call the function).
Note that nearly the whole <A HREF="hdrindex.html">TIGCC library</A>, when used in "nostub" mode,
is implemented using the typecast operator which converts TIOS jump table entries to pointers
to functions. For example, <A HREF="graph_ClrScr.html">ClrScr</A> is defined as
<CODE>'(*(void(**)(void))(*(long*)0xC8+0x678))'</CODE>, which is nothing other than a complex
typecast. So, when you do
<PRE>ClrScr ();
</PRE>
in your program, the <A HREF="cpp.html">preprocessor</A> replaces it with
<PRE>(*(void(**)(void))(*(long*)0xC8+0x678))();
</PRE>
However, typecast operator cannot be used to convert a scalar type to a
structure or union (and vice versa), or to convert one non-scalar type into an incompatible
non-scalar type. That's why casting to structures and unions are rarely valid.
<BR><BR>
Casting to a void means that you want to discard the result of the expression.
<BR><BR>
Casting to or from a floating point type are internally executed using the
<A HREF="timath_flt.html">flt</A> and <A HREF="timath_trunc.html">trunc</A> functions. See the description of
these functions for more info.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> GNU C extends the usage of typecast operator to allow making
<A HREF="gnuexts_SEC81.html">cast constructors</A>, which are probably the most powerful
GNU C extensions. It also allows much more flexibility in
<A HREF="gnuexts_SEC83.html">casting to an union types</A>.
