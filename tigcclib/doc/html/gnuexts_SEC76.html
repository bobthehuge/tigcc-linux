<P>Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an
extension GCC accepts them in C89 mode.  (However, GCC's
implementation of variable-length arrays does not yet conform in detail
to the ISO C99 standard.)  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:
<PRE>FILE *concat_fopen (const char *s1, const char *s2, const char *mode)
{
  char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
  strcpy (str, s1);
  strcat (str, s2);
  return fopen (str, mode);
}
</PRE>
Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.
<BR><BR>
You can use the function <A HREF="alloc_alloca.html">alloca</A> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <A HREF="alloc_alloca.html">alloca</A> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.
<BR><BR>
There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <A HREF="alloc_alloca.html">alloca</A> exists until the containing <I>function</I> returns.
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<A HREF="alloc_alloca.html">alloca</A> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <A HREF="alloc_alloca.html">alloca</A>.)
<BR><BR>
You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:
<PRE>struct entry
tester (int len, char data[len][len])
{
  /* ... */
}
</PRE>
The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<CODE><A HREF="keywords_sizeof.html">sizeof</A></CODE>.
<BR><BR>
If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list - another GNU extension.
<PRE>struct entry
tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
{
  /* ... */
}
</PRE>
The <CODE>int&nbsp;len</CODE> before the semicolon is a <U>parameter forward
declaration</U>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <I>len</I>
known when the declaration of <I>data</I> is parsed.
<BR><BR>
You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the &quot;real&quot;
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a &quot;real&quot;
declaration in parameter name and data type.  ISO C99 does not support
parameter forward declarations.
