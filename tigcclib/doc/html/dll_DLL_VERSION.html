<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Defines the DLL major and minor version numbers.</B>
<P>The DLL_VERSION macro is used for defining the DLL major and minor version numbers. It must be
followed by two 16-bit constant unsigned integers, which represent the major and minor version
numbers, respectively. For example:
<PRE>DLL_VERSION 2,13
</PRE>
Later, when a program wants to load the DLL, it passes the expected major and minor version numbers
as parameters to the <A HREF="dll_LoadDLL.html">LoadDLL</A> function. If the expected and actual major version numbers are not the
same, or if the expected minor version number is greater than actual minor version number, the DLL
is simply ignored (skipped). As <A HREF="dll_LoadDLL.html">LoadDLL</A> searches through all folders for a matching DLL, it is
legal to have several DLLs with the same name (in different folders) and with the same ID numbers,
but with different version numbers. <A HREF="dll_LoadDLL.html">LoadDLL</A> will load the first DLL found (if any) with a
matching name, ID number and major version number, and whose minor version number is greater
or equal to the expected minor version number.
<BR><BR>
DLL_ID must appear at the end of the DLL interface section, just after the <A HREF="dll_DLL_ID.html">DLL_ID</A> entry, and
just before the <A HREF="dll_DLL_EXPORTS.html">DLL_EXPORTS</A> entry. See <A HREF="dll_DLL_INTERFACE.html">DLL_INTERFACE</A> for a detailed layout of the DLL interface
structure.
